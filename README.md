# Firebase Realtime Database Race Condition with ServerValue.increment

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition when using Firebase's Realtime Database with transactions and `ServerValue.increment`.  Even within transactions, concurrent updates to the same data point can lead to incorrect results.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using atomic operations to mitigate the race condition.

## Problem

The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of database updates. While `ServerValue.increment` is convenient, it's not atomic in concurrent scenarios.  Two clients updating the same balance simultaneously may result in an incorrect final value.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing a more robust atomic operation to ensure data integrity. This often involves fetching the current value, performing the calculation locally, and then updating the database with the new value in a single transaction.  This eliminates the race condition.
